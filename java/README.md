# Java Exercises
These exercises have been written and tested in Java 8, although in general I would recommend using the most recent version of Java you have available. These exercises can be compiled and run from the command line, but I used [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with Maven.

Detailed instructions on each exercise will appear here shortly.
